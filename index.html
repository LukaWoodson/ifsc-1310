      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <h3>What is Progressive Enhancement?</h3>
            
            <p> While graceful degradation had been the norm for sites across the internet, meaning only the best and biggest browsers were used as test subjects to a websites functionality and abilities while the older browsers has a poor but passable experience, in 2003 two people introduced what is the norm of the modern age, progressive enhancement. The difference between the two, while they both focus on content, graceful degradation is really only optimised for the latest and greatest browsers. So if you used an older version of your favorite browser, or if you were stuck with one that didn't perform as well, you experience could be classified as subpar. With progressive enhancement you focus soley on the content. </p>
            
            <p>With progressive enhancement you start with the content first(HTML). Then worry about the presentation (CSS), and lastly the client-side scripting (JS). Starting with the HTML, you make it as detailed as you can so that targeting it is easier across multiple browsers and devices. Next with the CSS, not everything is going to look great cross platform. But there are still styling methods to make the user experience better when using less than desirable browsers or devices. And finally writing your Javascript, using unobtrusive Javascript you can cater functionality to a multitude of browsers and devices.</p>
            
            <blockquote>&quot The PE strategy helps you build a strong foundation for your project where your HTML, CSS, and JS are aligned and aim to provide fallbacks. They try to make sure youâ€™re not heavily relying only on browser specific features. &quot<cite>--<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">freecodecamp.org</a></cite></blockquote>
            
            <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
            
            <p>Summarizing progressive enhancement, it gives the user basic functionality and stability across platforms and browsers for a standard user experience. Every device and browser deserves to be able to interact in some way, shape, or form with the content on the sites. And progressive enhancement ensures just that. It is important because without it, users would still have a hard time accessing some websites if they were using browsers such as Internet Explorer, Lynx, Opera, and so on. If we focus soley on the browser's features it can implement on a specific device, we cut down our target audience range immensely.</p>
            <p>An example I can give from personal experience is back during Snowmageddon - February 2021, I lost power for a few days since I live so far out in the country. About 2 hours from UA Little Rock campus (give or take 30 minutes with traffic). I had to use my iPad to watch and check in to my lectures during this time. Unfortuneately whether it be UA Little Rock's issue, blackboard's issue, Apple's iPadOS issue, or Chrome itself on the iPad, I was scrambling each lecture day to try to load in to Collaborate Ultra because it was never the same thing twice. One day it would let me log in on Chrome and watch my lecture and participate just fine. The next time I couldn't log in at all and would have to scramble to Safari, but even then I couldn't participate, only watch. And then another day after that I could log in to Chrome again but the sound wouldn't come through. There was never just one issue from day to day, so it was hard to pin point what the actual problem was.</p>
            <p>Focusing on the content, implementing certain design methods in CSS, and then finally focusing on Javascript that could be implemented cross platform would probably have fixed several of these issues. I have had similar problems this semester, but for the most part it just seems to not load in at all. For now Safari calls my name time and again if I have to be mobile.</p>
